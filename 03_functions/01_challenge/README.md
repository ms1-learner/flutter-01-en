# Challenge 1

In this challenge, you're given a code file `convert.dart` that has two pre-defined variables `walkman` and `toothpaste`. There is also a predefined function `convert` that takes in a list of maps as a parameter and returns a list of lists. 

The main task here is to update `convert` to return a list that contains inner lists. Each inner list should contain the values associated with each map.

Expected Functionality:

```dart
convert([map1, map2, map3]); // [[all values of map1], [all values of map2], [all values of map 3]]
```

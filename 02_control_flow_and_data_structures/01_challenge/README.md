# Challenge 1

In this challenge, you're given a Dart file `calcStats.dart` with a pre-defined function, `calculateStats`. Your task is to write a program that calculates some stats about a list of `phrases`. Here is a summary of what you should do:

- Loop over `phrases` and find the longest phrase. Save it in a variable.
- Loop over the longest phrase you found and remove any vowels from it. Save the result in a variable.
- Modify the `stats` map with the corresponding values:
  - `longestPhrase`: The longest phrase you found in `phrases`.
  - `longestPhraseWithoutVowels`: The no-vowel version of the longest phrase.
  - `longestPhraseLength`: The length of the longest phrase.
  - `reversedList`: `phrases` reversed.

Write everything inside the body of the `calculateStats` function between the two code comments `/* Start of your code */` and `/* End of your code */`. 

Don't modify any starter code.

Note: We didn't cover functions yet but this challenge doesn't require any prior knowledge about functions.
